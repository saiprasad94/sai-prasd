For primary understanding of git 

Here i understood that the changes i make in this step will be in another branch and do not reflect on the the main master branch.

Regarding the assignement.
1)I completed my bachlors degree in mechanical but i found my intrest in chomputers. In my final year of bachlors i decied to get a job in Software and cracked the interviews in TechMahindra and TCS for Associate-Software-eingneer Position.
2)I worked there for two years and then i learnt that "I still have to learn a lot". i am here.
3)I had few ideas to be implemented.
  i needed even more knowlwdge of how to make it executed.
4) after my masters i will try finding a job which would ge me a practial knowlege on how the business works.
